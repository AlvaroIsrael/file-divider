# File Divider

A simple program to divide a file by byte sizes once you need a file to be at that exact byte size amount.
It was made with Kotlin.
It's important to keep in mind that most of the bussiness logic written here were hard codded, so if you are planning on using this program anywhere you should take some time to re-write the bussiness logic.
